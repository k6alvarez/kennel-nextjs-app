# Boomers Studio Web App Template

This repository is the boilerplate setup for a fullstack web app with authentication.
App is built with Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and deployed to Vercel.

Technologies used:

- Next.js as the React framework
- Next.js API routes for server-side API routes as the backend
- Prisma as the ORM for migrations and database access
- PostgreSQL as the database
- NextAuth.js for authentication via GitHub (OAuth)
- TypeScript as the programming language
- Vercel for deployment

To successfully setup this app, you'll need:

- Node.js
- A PostgreSQL Database
- A GitHub Account (to create an OAuth app for login)
- A Google Developer Accoount (to create an OAuth app for login)
- A Mailtrap Account for testing emails sent by the application
- A Vercel Account (to deploy the app)

First lets setup our database using Heroku's Postgres SQL service. We will then use Prisma as our objectâ€“relational mapper (ORM) to access the database in our Node.js and TypeScript application.

- Login to Heroku and create a new app and navigate to the Resources tab.
- Add Heroku Postgres using the Add-ons section. The free hobby version will work just fine.
- Lets go ahead and create our .env file now so that we can add our database environment variables set up. Create a new .env in the root of you app directory or rename the provided .env.example file. It contains all of the values we will need to get set up.
- Next navigate to the settings tab and in the Config Vars section, copy the value for DATABASE_URL into the .env file we created.

Next lets set up our configurations for the remaining environment variables. At bare minimum you will need to set up a mailtrap accoount to enable email signin. You may remove or add any signin provider supported by NextAuth.js

Lets install dependencies and seed our db.

- `npm i`
- `npx prisma db push`
- `npm run dev`
- In a new tab run `npx prisma studio` for viewing your database tables.

You can now beging to create your web application!
